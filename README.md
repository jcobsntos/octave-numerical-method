# Numerical Root-Finding in Octave

## 🔥 Introduction
🎉 Welcome to the Numerical Root-Finding in Octave repository! This project showcases three powerful numerical methods for finding roots of equations using GNU Octave. Whether you're a student, researcher, or just curious about numerical computing, this repository is a great starting point!

## 🎯 Features

✔️ Easy-to-understand implementations

✔️ Well-commented Octave code 📝

✔️ Plots 📈 for better visualization

✔️ Works with different equations & initial values ⚙️


## 📊 Implemented Methods

### 📌 Bisection Method

✔️ Finds roots by repeatedly halving intervals ✂️

✔️ Guaranteed convergence but slower ⏳

### ⚡ Newton-Raphson Method

✔️ Uses derivatives for faster convergence 🚀

✔️ May fail if the derivative is zero ❌

### 🔄 Secant Method

✔️ A derivative-free alternative to Newton-Raphson

✔️ Faster than Bisection but not always stable ⚠️
